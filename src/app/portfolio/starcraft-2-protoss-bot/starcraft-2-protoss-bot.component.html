      This project contains a Python implementation of a bot that plays the StarCraft 2 game, made by Blizzard
      Entertainment, as the Protoss race. The bot is split into subsystems that work in tandem to accomplish victory.
      The top level AI is the bot which manages its units using Armies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Army AI in its current form looks for enemies on the map and, if it is deemed strong enough, engages the
      enemy. If it sees enemies and determines that they are weaker, it attacks the enemies with the entire group.
      Otherwise, it retreats back to base. After retreating, the army waits a while before going into battle again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unit's AI moves toward the command indicated by the army (Move, MoveAttack, or DefendLocation). Depending on
      the command held, the unit switches from the GroupMovement state to the Fight state, where it is in combat mode.
      For example, for the Move command, the unit ignores nearby enemies, but if the command is MoveAttack and the unit
      in GroupMovement state sees an enemy, it enters fight mode. On the other hand, for the command DefendLocation, the
      unit ignores nearby enemies unless it is at a sufficient distance from the place it should protect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Fight state, the unit switches between the AttackBestTarget and AvoidInjury states. When a unit has plenty
      of life points and a shield, it selects the best target to attack and fights. Otherwise, when the unit receives
      damage, it temporarily retreats to allow enemy units to focus on its remaining companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Army AI is implemented with a Behavior Tree and a single unit's AI is made with both Behavior Tree and
      Hierarchical State Machine â€“ it is possible to switch between both. Unit's AI HFSM and Behavior Tree can be
      illustrated as below:
