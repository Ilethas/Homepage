  This project serves as a demo application that shows how to create various effects using OpenGL. It allows loading a
  3D scene that is set up specifically for some effect. The user can then tweak various parameters, like for example
  exposure for HDR effect.
</p>
<p>Every scene allows for its specialized operations, as well as basic ones, like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating lights of different types (Point, Directional, Spot)</li>
  <li>Modifying their properties (Position, Direction, Brightness, Attenuation Radius, Color, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each scene has a customized "Description" tab that explains how the particular graphics effect works. A total of 8
  OpenGL techniques are implemented:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Lighting Models</li>
  <li>Normal Mapping</li>
  <li>Gamma Correction</li>
  <li>HDR</li>
  <li>Bloom</li>
  <li>Toon Outline Shader</li>
  <li>Gerstner Waves</li>
  <li>Stencil Buffer â€“ Selecting Objects</li>
</ol>
